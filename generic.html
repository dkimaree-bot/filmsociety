								<h3>About Seneca Film Society</h3>
								<p>The Seneca Film Society is a student-run group for anyone who loves movies and wants to get a bit more out of the viewing experience. We aren’t a formal film program, and we aren't trying to turn you into a professional director overnight. Instead, we’re a club built on shared experiences, good conversation, and simply enjoying movies together.</p>

								<p>Our meetings range from laid-back movie nights to more interactive activities. Some nights are all about sitting down to watch something great and chatting afterward about what worked, what didn't, and which scenes stayed with us. Other events are more hands-on, featuring creative challenges or casual workshops where you can try things out without any pressure.</p>

								<hr />

								<h4>Events and Activities</h4>
								<p>Throughout the year, we organize larger events like themed screenings and collaborations with other campus clubs. We try to keep a balance between casual and engaged so that both relaxed viewers and serious film buffs feel comfortable. You don’t need any special gear or prior knowledge to join us. If you’re interested in film, that’s plenty. We also make an effort to get off campus. We plan group trips to local theaters and spaces like TIFF to see films the way they were intended. These outings are a great way to connect outside of our usual meetings and build real friendships within the club.</p>

								<p>At the end of the day, Seneca Film Society is about community. We’re here to watch films, talk about them honestly, and learn from one another in a welcoming environment. Whether you show up every week or just once in a while, there’s a spot for you here.</p>
